This project is to create a decent class library for interacting with Steam Trades and other parts of the Steam network.

# PREREQS #
You MUST have Visual Studio 2015. Older versions may work, but all testing has been done using Visual Studio 2015. All of the sample code is confirmed working on that specific compiler.
